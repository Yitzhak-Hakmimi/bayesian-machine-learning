# Bayesian Machine Learning

**Traditional A/B testing has been around for a long time, and it’s full of approximations and confusing definitions.**

While I will implement traditional A/B testing in order to appreciate its complexity, the main target is that I will eventually get to Bayesian machine learning way of doing things.

### 1. [Traditional A-B Testing](https://github.com/sourcecode369/bayesian-machine-learning/tree/master/Traditional%20AB%20Testing) 
> First, we’ll see if we can improve on traditional A/B testing with adaptive methods. These will help to solve the explore-exploit dilemma.

### 2. [Bayesian A-B Testing](https://www.github.com/sourcecode369)
> Will also implement the epsilon-greedy algorithm, which one can find in the context of reinforcement learning.

### 3. [Epsilon Greedy Alogrithm & Upper Confidence Bound](https://www.github.com/sourcecode369)
> We’ll improve upon the epsilon-greedy algorithm with a similar algorithm called UCB1.

### 4. [Fully Bayesian Machine Learning](https://www.github.com/sourcecode369)
> Finally, we’ll improve on both of those by using a fully Bayesian approach.

**Why is the Bayesian method interesting to us in machine learning?**

    It’s an entirely different way of thinking about probability.

    It’s a paradigm shift.

    Bayesian ML plays a key role in Reinforcement Learning and I had to visit the concepts several times before it fully sinked in.

     It’s also powerful, and many machine learning experts often make statements about how they “subscribe to the Bayesian school of thought”.
